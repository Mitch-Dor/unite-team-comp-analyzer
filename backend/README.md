# To Run

```
node app.js
```

## How It Works

App.js creates a network, and calls database.js to connect to the database. Then it uses routes to touch functions in the database folder. Database folder is for actually getting information from the database while routes is for sending it to the frontend. The route in the frontend is how the frontend will get the information.
